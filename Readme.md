At this point the original title is inaccurate. There no longer is just 10 books... but 55. And that's only the endpoints of the book tree.



###### Quarantine proved to be the perfect time to spend more than a week pretty much only designing some intersections. I've got to 107 before I finally said to myself: "ENOUGH". Actually, there were 214 (rail) blueprints (now 218), but half of that is just versions with solar panels and accumulators fit in between the lanes because "why not?". At first, these were called "Books of 1001 Railway Blueprints" and there were 10 books to get separately, but since 1.0 came out, I've decided to finally make use of book nesting and do some polishing/updates with the recent features and some new ideas. Hope you'll enjoy, and remember: Factory Must Grow.

</font></div>

- All blueprints are always upgradable into their equivalents from other books placed lower on the list in the "Rail Book Categories" section as long as they are in the same category
 - some blueprints are upgradable into others from the same book or even other categories
   - some of that upgradability was sacrificed for the sake of throughput
 - to achieve that, many blueprints don't have the best possible signal placement
- Each book comes in 2 variants:
 - standard (no ![solar panel](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Solar_panel.png/32px-Solar_panel.png) &![accumulator](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Accumulator.png/32px-Accumulator.png))
 - ![solar panel](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Solar_panel.png/32px-Solar_panel.png) &![accumulator](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Accumulator.png/32px-Accumulator.png) included because why would you want to waste so much space (aesthetics first though)
   - there are some paths left between solar panels so you can get run over by a train again
- Rail Spacing: ![rail](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Straight_rail.png/32px-Straight_rail.png) - - ![rail](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Straight_rail.png/32px-Straight_rail.png) - - - ![rail](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Straight_rail.png/32px-Straight_rail.png) - - ![rail](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Straight_rail.png/32px-Straight_rail.png)
- Made for 6 ![locomotive](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Locomotive.png/32px-Locomotive.png)/![cargo wagon](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Cargo_wagon.png/32px-Cargo_wagon.png) long trains, but works well with 2, and 3 ![locomotive](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Locomotive.png/32px-Locomotive.png)/![cargo wagon](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Cargo_wagon.png/32px-Cargo_wagon.png) (to maximize throughput add signals on non-crossing lanes) and with multiples of 6 (you'll need to increase space between intersections accordingly to avoid potential deadlocks)
- ![green wire](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Green_wire.png/32px-Green_wire.png) & ![red wire](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Red_wire.png/32px-Red_wire.png) + ![small lamp](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Lamp.png/32px-Lamp.png) included
- Modular
- Right-Hand Drive
- Each section is 21x21 ![rail](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Straight_rail.png/32px-Straight_rail.png) or 42x42 tiles big (books are focused on throughput for 6  ![locomotive](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Locomotive.png/32px-Locomotive.png)/![cargo wagon](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Cargo_wagon.png/32px-Cargo_wagon.png) trains and that is exactly the border length of the square in which all blueprints here fit, hence they are not chunk aligned)
- Grid and Absolute Reference Point are on, so you can use them like a "chunk aligned network" (blueprints can only be placed on an artificial grid that lets you start building from 2 completely disconnected points on the map and ensures that they can still be perfectly connected, see [FFF #357](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-357) under the "Snapping" section)
- Every blueprint has ![landfill](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Landfill.png/32px-Landfill.png) underlay to allow placing on water (Shift+LMB to place landfill, and LMB to place blueprint, you can also just double-click Shift+LMB)

# Notes:


### Rails:

- Most of your network will consist of blueprints from Category A, Category B will find some use for sure, but these books are more specialized, and Category C will be used very rarely if at all 
- Outer lanes in 4-way Intersections from 4 Lane books (category A) do not have left turns. Use Line changers provided
- Category B has some split junctions. The main difference between B and C is that category C blueprints all have the same number of lanes. Blueprints from category B don't
- Remember to leave enough space between each section with lanes crossing each other to fit the longest train that is going to use that part of your network. Otherwise, when it stops on the next signal, it WILL block trains on other lanes. That is true for any train network, not only one built with my blueprints
- No ![roboport](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Roboport.png/32px-Roboport.png) between rails so you don't accidentally recreate [Population transfers in the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_transfer_in_the_Soviet_Union), except bots. The real reason: 1. bots have a limited supply of power. 2. When it depletes, they go to recharge at the nearest roboport. 3. They go straight to their destination without considering their power reserves. That means that if you have a "C" shaped logistic network (that often forms with rails), where the distance in a straight line between both ends of this "C" is 2x greater than your robot's range, it won't reach its destination and instead, its power reserves will deplete, the bot will come back to where it started to recharge and try again thus falling into an endless loop
- ![copper cable](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Copper_cable.png/32px-Copper_cable.png) look cool
- Floor tiles seen on the rail pictures are included in the book but require [Asphalt Roads](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/AsphaltRoads) mod to work, (there is a vanilla version too, but it's not as pretty). Feel free to use those for designing your own rail blueprints. If you go for a different grid size [they're for 6 ![locomotive](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Locomotive.png/32px-Locomotive.png)/![cargo wagon](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Cargo_wagon.png/32px-Cargo_wagon.png)(length) or 21x21 ![rail](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Straight_rail.png/32px-Straight_rail.png) or 42x42 tiles] you'll have to rescale them


### Other:

- There is a lot of Factorio's in-game Rich Text - it's awesome, believe me
- If you don't have aforementioned mods (LTN, Asphalt Roads) You'll get some error messages in the chat when importing this book. That only means that you won't be able to use blueprints that require those mods. All of them have vanilla friendly equivalents. You don't need those mods to make use of my blueprints
- I'm no master of LTN nor I consider myself to be any close to one, so the logic is one of the simplest you can do. If you'd like to make something more sophisticated that would be compatible with my blueprints, go ahead, but post it as your own. Let me know, and I'll link it here



# Known Issues:
- Most books included here have their names display a bit bugged when in grid view in the blueprint library. I don't think I can do anything about it  without changing their names and/or used Rich Text (reported to devs)

          
# The Plan
- ~~Add bot serviced stations~~ (abandoned, at least for now)
- New category - D - merging C and B by creating Split intersections (C) where exits have a different amount of lanes (B). Would anyone ever use one of those? That's the main reason holding me back, so let me know if you'd like something like this
- Idk, maybe I've missed some blueprint? If so, let me know, and I'll make it
- If you have any suggestions on how I could improve this book, let me know. I can't promise that I'll check the comments often, but better late than never



# Change Log:

18:00 UTC 22.08.2020
- Added the missing accumulator to "![](https://factorioprints.com/icons/signal-D.png)iagonal ![](https://factorioprints.com/icons/signal-4.png)-way" from "<span style="color:cyan">4 ![rail](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Straight_rail.png/32px-Straight_rail.png) ![solar panel](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Solar_panel.png/32px-Solar_panel.png)</span>" book
