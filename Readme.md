# 107-Rail-Blueprints-with-solar-alternatives-all-Books-of-1001-Railway-Blueprints-books-in-one-ne
###### Quarantine proved to be the perfect time to spend more than a week pretty much only designing some intersections. I've got to 107 before I finally said to myself: "ENOUGH" (I've still had some ideas tho). Actually, there are 214 blueprints, but half of that is just versions with solar panels and accumulators fit in between the lanes because "why not?". At first, these were called"Books of 1001 Railway Blueprints" and there were 10 books to get separately, but since 1.0 came out, I've decided to finally make use of this new "book nesting" feature so it's all in one now. I also really wanted to save it on Factorio Prints, but for some reason it wouldn't save. Hope you'll enjoy, and remember: Factory Must Grow.
# Features: 
- all blueprints are always upgradeable into their equivalents from other books placed lower on the list below as long as they are in the same category
 - there are exceptions to this rule as there are blueprints upgradable into others from the same book or even other categories
  - some of that upgradability was sacrificed for the sake of throughput
 - to achieve that, many blueprints don't have the best possible signal placement
- each book comes in 2 variants:
 - standard
 - solar panels & accumulators included because why would you want to waste so much space (aesthetics first though)
   - there are some paths left between solar panels so you can get run over by a train again
- lane spacing is: 3 rail tracks between inner lanes and 2 rail tracks between outer and inner lanes
- made for 6 car trains, but works well with 2, and 3 cars (to maximize throughput add signals on non-crossing lanes) and with multiples of 6 (you'll need to increase space between intersections accordingly to avoid potential deadlocks)
- green & red wires + lights included
- modular
- right-hand drive
- Rich Text heavy - it's awesome, believe me
- each section is 21x21 rail tracks or 42x42 tiles big (books are focused on throughput for 6 car trains and that is exactly the length of the rectangle in which all blueprints here fit, hence they are not chunk aligned)

# Notes:

- Outer lanes in 4-way Intersections from 4 Lane books (category A) do not have left turns. Use Line changers provided
- Category B has some split junctions. The main difference between B and C is that category C blueprints all have the same number of lanes. Blueprints from category B don't
- Remember to leave enough space between each section with lanes crossing to fit the longest train that is going to use that part of your network. Otherwise, when it stops on the next signal, it WILL block trains on other lanes. That is true for any train network, not only one built with my blueprints
- No roboports so you don't accidentally recreate [Population transfers in the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_transfer_in_the_Soviet_Union), except bots
- wires look cool
